# Dasmoto's Arts and Crafts

This was the capstone project in the section "Intro to Local Website Development", the first section in [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn)'s Web Dev Path. The project was done after introductionary lessons in HTML and CSS.


## Project Instructions
In this project, you’ll build a simple website for a fictional arts and crafts store using the tools on your own computer. This project will provide you with less guidance than previous projects. You should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

At a high-level, this project will require the following:

A folder structure that makes sense for the project
An HTML file
A CSS file
To successfully complete the project, you’ll require the following images:

* [Image 1](images/finnish.jpeg)
* [Image 2](images/frames.jpeg)
* [Image 3](images/hacksaw.jpeg)
* [Image 4](images/pattern.jpeg)

The rest of the page’s styling (font sizes, colors, etc.) is outlined in the following design spec, which is a standard document you’d expect to receive as a freelance web developer:

Use the website to the right and the resources above to guide you through the project.
